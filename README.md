# GEOG5990-Assessment-1
This repository is for assessment 1 of the course of GEOG5990.
This is README, including agentframework file, animatedmodel file and in file.
Both python files(agentframework.py and animatedmodel.py) are finished and tested in the "Spyder".
The right steps to run files are to open two files and run the agentframework.py and then run the animatedmodel.py.
Note that the Bakend of Graphics is "Tkinter", which can be found on the top of the window(Tools-References-Ipython console-Graphics-Backend-Tkinter).
When it runs, two pop-up windows called "Figure" and "Model" respectively are shown. Meanwhile, Console 1/A window shows <td class="y">int</td>,<td class="x">int</td> and values in "in.txt".
If clicking on "Run model" on the menu of "Model" of Model window, then the animation appears with the green-blue background in the square of 300*300. Ten points move from top-left corner to differen and random directions and leave the moving path represented as shadows.
Console 1/A window shows some texts and figures starting from "Move Eat and Share" and ending by "Plot", which represents a loop.
The process is iterated 100 times and then the animation and the Console 1/A window stop updating until clicking "Run model" again to continue the process. If this action is repeated enough, then an increasing area of shadow will cover the background.
This animation simulates the process by which 10 sheeps eat grass.
